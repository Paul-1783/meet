# meet

A serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

## Project Features and Scenarios

```
- Feature 2.: As a user,
  I want details to be shown to me about an event which looks promising to me,
  but also to be hidden,
  so that I can see if if the respective event is interesting or not.

  Scenario 1. An event element is collapsed by default.
  • Given the app has not been used yet;
  • When the app gets started;
  • Then the user shouldn‘t see that event
  Scenario 2. User can expand an event to see details.
  • Given the event hasn‘t been clicked yet or already been closed before;
  • When the user selects the event;
  • Then the user should see the details of the respective event.
  Scenario 3. User can collapse an event to hide details.
  • Given the event has already been selected by the user;
  • When the user selects the event one time more;
  • Then the events collapses.
```
